prompt:
I want you to act as an experienced data engineer.
Please implement a full ML pipeline with steps: reducing memory, filling NaN, removing unrelated columns, remove high correlated columns, feature selection using RFECV with a machine learning model such as decision tree, training and tuning model with stratified K-Fold Cross Validation and ensemble (using stacking)
Also, give me a data overview. EDA, in the code. Give me a way to quantify the data that I give you in order to fine tune the pipeline.
Split the code into sections, like someone would in an ipynb.
The data will be provided in test.csv and train.csv in a kaggle dataset "VOAI_TRAINING".
Provide data in graphs (matplotlib) if possible.

here are the columns [insert columns here]

all of them are numerical features

Give me the code in sections that would correspond to something in a jupyter notebook.

Read the files from [files]

I am concerned about the performance so only take 5k non-null samples for the EDA plots.

Remember to use pipelines and RFECV.

The target is numerical, not categorical.
Add progress bars wherever you can.
Use RFECV, K=3, Decision Tree
Model is Ensemble RF + DT + Linear Regression
Use K-Fold CV (K=3) + Grid Search

Split the train.csv into 8:2 for train/test, and report MAE for both.
Remember to save the "engineered" dataset.
